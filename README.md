# C Learn/Relearn

In this repository I save my studies of concepts in C. I will gradually add here everything I am relearning,
including explanation of advanced concepts.

It is worth noting that this repository does not have any objective in focus, just remembering and improving some programming concepts in C. As I do not work with the language,
I consider it very important to practice some concepts that I use in other languages in this amazing low-level language from time to time.
